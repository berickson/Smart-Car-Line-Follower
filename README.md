My dad built a smart car robot and added down facing IR sensors to make it into a line follower. It worked fine but he wanted it to go faster so he switched from 2 LiPo batteries to 3 to make it faster.  It went faster, then got unstable.  He gave it to me to try to make it stable.

I changed the line detection algorithm and added live tuning over bluetooth.  After tweaking the PID parameters, it works a little better, but not the greatest yet, so I'm still looking for improvements.
